What is REPL in Node.js?
--> REPL stands for:
--> Read — takes your input (what you type)
--> Eval — evaluates (runs) the code
--> Print — prints the result/output
--> Loop — keeps waiting for more input

--> REPL is like a mini-lab inside Node.js where you can test JavaScript code line by line. No need to create files or run full programs — just experiment freely!
